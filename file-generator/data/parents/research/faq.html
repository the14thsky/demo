                <p>Cord blood is the blood that remains in the umbilical cord and in the placenta after child birth. The umbilical cord and the placenta together with the blood in it, is usually discarded after the baby has been delivered. The blood in the
                  umbilical cord is found to be a rich source of blood stem cells, which are also known as “haematopoietic” stem cells. These stem cells have been successfully used in the treatment of blood related cancers, immune and genetic diseases.</p>

                <p>Stem cells are the primitive cells found in various tissues of the body that can differentiate into the specific functional cells of various tissues. They are the source of tissue renewal, repair and growth. Blood stem cells, or “haematopoietic”
                  stem cells, are those that produce the steady stream of blood cells, such as white, red cells and platelets that will keep the body healthy. The source of blood stem cells are bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood and umbilical cord
                  blood.

                <p>The Singapore Cord Blood Bank (SCBB) is not able to accept a cord blood storage from an expectant mother with twin or multiple pregnancies as it is considered a high-risk pregnancy. SCBB advocates that the safety of the mother and baby
                  is/are of utmost importance. Further, there could be a possibility of mixing or confusing the tissue types of the two umbilical cords. As the tissue types are used to match a cord blood unit (CBU) to a patient, any potential mix-up in

                  and stringent public cord blood banking criteria, thus, not all donated umbilical cord blood can be stored at the SCBB. In order to meet international requirement for a life-saving cord blood transplant, all collected CBUs will be evaluated
                  for volume of blood, cell count, cell viability, and infectious disease amongst other panel of testing requirements. These will ensure only samples of the highest quality are banked and made available to patients in need of cord blood
                  stem cells for cord blood transplant procedures. Suitable samples will then be prepared for storage at -180° Celsius, in cryogenic tanks, until they are required for HSCT. When CBUs do not meet the banking requirements, it may be assigned
                  for approved research. In cases where the maternal donor has indicated that she does not want the cord blood unit for research, it will be discarded according to normal hospital protocols.</p>

                  <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Umbilical cord blood is rich in life-saving stem cells, as described above. Rather than discard it after delivery, which is done frequently, you can donate it to give someone a chance at a cure.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Donating cord blood to a centralised public cord blood bank such as the SCBB increases the number of cord blood units available to all potential stem cell transplant patients. This therefore increases the chances of finding a match
                      for the patient.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Donation is even more urgent when we know that ethnicity plays an important role in finding a stem cell match. The donation of umbilical cord blood units that matches the ethnicity of the population is critical in helping to save lives
                      of needy patients.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Since the first unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant in 1993, over 30,000 cord blood transplants have been performed around the world. These patients received unrelated cord blood units that were generously donated to a public

                      The benefit of cord blood donation is having the satisfaction of knowing that someone else’s life could be saved using the donated cord blood unit.

                    <p>Cord blood donation is medically safe. The process poses minimal health risks to the mother or baby. The birth experience will also not be affected as the cord blood is only collected after the safe delivery of your baby. The blood
                      is collected from the umbilicus vein from the section of the cord that remains attached to the placenta, not the baby. The safety and well being of both mother and baby will always be of primary importance.</p>

                        <p>A pre-screening evaluation of the eligibility to donate will be conducted during a face-to-face meeting or telephone interview. Questions to ensure that the mother and infant donor meets SCBB’s established criteria for donation,
                          including the birth parents and family medical history, will be asked. This will help to ascertain donor suitability before proceeding to the next stage of donation.</p>

                        <p>The next stage involves taking informed consent from the mother. SCBB’s donor coordinators will arrange for a counselling session for the mother to understand the implications and process of donation. The mother would need to complete
                          and sign the Volunteer and Informed Consent Form and the Maternal Risk Questionnaire.</p>

                        <p>The next stage involves the collection of blood sample from the mother before delivery takes place. Approximately 30mls, about three soupspoons, will be collected and used for evaluation of infectious diseases. This procedure is
                          necessary to ensure that all cord blood units collected are free of all infectious diseases and safe for transplant.</p>
